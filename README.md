# E6AutoTagger

## [Original/Base by meusartis](https://github.com/Meus-Artis/e6AutoTagger) Recoded and improved by Me!


~Not so~ Simple [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script to allow use of [JTP Pilot](https://huggingface.co/RedRocket/JointTaggerProject) furry auto tagger on all 3 E6 based websites (E621, E629, E6AI).


## Features
* Confidence threshold **0.1 - 1**
* Tag sort button + Setting when Generating tags
* Configurable endpoint (Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:7860/api/predict)
* Blacklist tags from being added (Prevents tags from being added)
* Auto tag to be added (This is like a section where the User can put tags they want to be ALWAYS added)
* Anti tag nuke button (Makes it so tags don't get nuked when auto tagging things)
* Tag auto suggest (Suggests tag in the config boxes like in the normal tag box)
* Status indacator
